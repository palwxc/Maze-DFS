# Maze DFS

Practice for developing a Depth First Search algorithm, used for solving a user defined maze.

### Prerequisites

A development environment will be needed to test this project. [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/) was used for the development of this project.

### Testing

Tests for this project can be run through the command line. Sample inputs and outputs can be found in the files:

```
sample_input.txt
sample_output.txt
```

These test the program's ability to solve user defined mazes and return the solution, if one is found.
